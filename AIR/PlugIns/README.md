To use iOS 10+ rich notifications, you must [create a **.appex** file using xcode](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/ios-sdk-setup#section-1-add-notification-service-extension) and place it inside a folder named '**PlugIns**' then make sure you are adding this folder to your project so it will be available in your compiled .ipa file.

**NOTICE:** When adding the 'PlugIns' folder to your project, make sure you have removed this README.md file!
